Macros are written as commands, each line is an action. Commands with parameters require parentheses:

Single parameter example:
```
Message ("Hello World")
```

Multiple parameters separated by commas:

```
Insert File (3,"C:\midi\file.mid")
```

This inserts the MIDI file `file.mid` into clip slot number 3.
