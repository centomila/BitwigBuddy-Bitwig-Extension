# 📋 Changelog:

**0.8.0**  
This is the biggest update so far! 🎉  
Please give me feedback on the new features and let me know if you find any bugs. The custom patterns feature is still a little buggy, so please be careful when using it.  

- [X] Added a Pattern Type Selector with:  
  - [X] Preset Patterns (Default)  
  - [X] Random Patterns (Previously available through the Preset list)  
  - [X] Custom Patterns  
- [X] Added a new feature to use custom patterns in txt format! 📄
  - Preference panel  
    - Path of the custom pattern files (default is Documents/Bitwig Studio/Extensions/BeatBuddy)  
    - Button to open the custom patterns folder  
    - Button to browse for a custom patterns folder  
    - Button to reset the custom patterns folder to the default path  
  - Check in the BeatBuddy folder for the file `SampleCustomPreset.txt` to see an example of how to create custom patterns  
    - The file is a simple text file with the following structure:  
      ```
      Name: "Sample Custom Preset"
      DefaultNote: "C1"
      Pattern: [100, 0, 0, 0, 100, 0, 0, 0, 100, 0, 0, 0, 100, 0, 0, 0]
      ```
    - DefaultNote is not yet implemented, but it will be used in the future to set the default note destination for the custom pattern  
- [X] Now the content of the selected pattern is displayed in the UI  
  - The user can edit the pattern directly in the UI (not ideal for long patterns)  
  - Up to 128 steps  
  - 0 means no note, 127 means the maximum velocity  
  - Steps can be separated by any character (comma, space, etc.)  
- [X] Learn Note button to automatically set the note destination based on the last pressed note 🎹  
  - When enabled, the user can click on any note in the piano roll or press a key on the MIDI keyboard to set the note destination  
  - The track needs to be selected  
  - It is not necessary for the track to be armed if you click on the piano roll with the Piano Roll’s *Audition Notes* option enabled  
  - This is a big improvement for the workflow and is very fun when used in combination with the Random Patterns feature. 🥳  
- [X] POST Actions 🏁  
  - [X] Show/Hide Post Actions options 👁️  
  - [X] Added an On/Off option to automatically Zoom To Fit the clip after the pattern is generated 🔍  
  - [X] Added an On/Off option to automatically duplicate the clip after the pattern is generated (Clip Launcher only) 2️⃣  
    - Super fun for creating variations of the pattern!  
- [X] Added a Support Section in Preferences  
  - [X] Added a button to open the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/centomila/BeatBuddy-Bitwig-Extension-MIDI-Drum-Generator) 🧑‍💻  
  - [X] Added a button to open my [Patreon Page](https://www.patreon.com/centomila) 🙏  
  - [X] Added a button to open [My Website](https://centomila.com) 🪞  


**0.7.6**
- [X] Code refactoring and split in multiple files. No changes to the bwextension.

**0.7.5**
- [X] Added rotate patterns
  - New buttons to rotate notes left or right
  - Unlike move steps, rotating wraps the notes around (the leftmost note moves to the rightmost position or vice versa)
  - Useful for creating variations of existing patterns
- ⚠️ Note: Move and Rotate operations currently only work with notes on MIDI channel 1. This might be related to a bug in the Bitwig Controller API - investigation is ongoing.


**0.7.1**  
- [X] The single line buttons for moving the pattern by one step were causing problems. Now, there are two separate buttons: <<< and >>>.  
  - This fixes the problem of the broken undo action.
- [X] Fixed a bug that caused unpredictable step movement if the length of the individual steps was different.  


0.7.0
- [X] Fixed Quintuplets (5t) and Septuplets (7t).
- [X] Added 1/1 step size/note length.
- [X] Added a "Move Steps" button to shift the pattern by one step in the x-direction.
  - ⚠️ This creates a lot of actions! Once done, you will not be able to undo any action prior to the "Move Steps" action.
- [X] Added a "Reverse Pattern" checkbox to reverse the pattern before it is generated.
  - This is not the _Reverse_ or _Reverse Pattern_ action in Bitwig Studio. It simply flips the order of the pattern selected by the user.
